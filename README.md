I remember when I was 16, looking across the door of my senior’s while they were testing their robot’s functionality with their laptop. At that time, I did wonder to myself: how were they doing such things? Was it magic? I wish! but no. I answered that question when I started my journey with Python and my first "hello world.”
since then 
 
I have equipped myself with the mindset of breaking down problems to their first principles while devising creative strategies to overcome them, which has helped in many of my projects. In addition, I embody strong interpersonal skills that complement my collaboration with cross-functional teams. Communication not only gets the job done smoother but also makes the team stronger, and a stronger team delivers results.
 
while I do have quite a few languages in my cabinet. The world of a software engineer is vast and interlinked, which has set me on exploring new tools, languages, and methodologies, allowing me to be more than competent but resourceful.
 
I am eager to contribute to projects that push and stabilise the boundaries of what software to be while making a positive impact throughout.
